## What Is New In v2.1.0 (Compared To OBS-2)

### New Features Added

- **AI Scripture Assistant (Live Scripture HUD)** — a floating, real-time detection panel that listens to spoken audio during worship or preaching and automatically identifies Bible references and song cues. Works for both Bible verse projection and song lyrics display. Runs fully offline with Local AI (Moonshine) or in the cloud via Deepgram — no interruption to your flow
- **Independent Lower Third and Full Screen Backgrounds** — Lower Third and Full Screen modes now each carry their own dedicated background layer (solid color, image, video, or YouTube). A single Link toggle instantly mirrors both modes to the same background whenever consistency is needed
- Dedicated AI Helper desktop app with relay-based control and a clean companion UI
- Cross-platform helper packaging for macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon), Windows (installer and portable), and Linux (AppImage and zip)
- New feedback pipeline: local backend and Cloudflare Worker deployment option for public issue intake
- Expanded vMix workflow support with display URL tools, connection state UI, and advanced output routing controls
- New tutorial hub module and broader modular project structure for maintainability

### Fixes And Reliability Improvements

- Major sync/output runtime hardening to reduce state drift and improve live output consistency
- Better relay/session resilience with reconnect actions and clearer connection visibility in UI
- Improved state persistence and sanitization for recent/pinned Bible references and host settings
- Better input safety through typing shortcut guards to prevent accidental hotkey triggers while editing fields
- Startup behavior improvements including vMix reconnect-on-start and safer restore flows

## Feedback Backend

To let the in-app Feedback form create GitHub issues directly, run the bundled backend:

1. Set environment variables:
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN` = a GitHub token with issue write access
   - `GITHUB_REPO` = `Johnbatey/bible-song-pro-obs` (or another `owner/repo`)
   - Optional: `FEEDBACK_PORT` = backend port, default `8787`
2. Start the server:
   - `npm run feedback:server`
3. Start the app and use the Feedback tab. The public build uses the bundled default feedback endpoint automatically.

Health check:
- `http://127.0.0.1:8787/health`

The backend keeps the GitHub token on the server side and returns the created issue URL to the app.

---

## Feedback Worker

For public deployment without keeping your PC running, use the Cloudflare Worker in [feedback-worker](feedback-worker).

Quick path:

1. `cd feedback-worker`
2. `npm install`
3. `npx wrangler login`
4. `npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN`
5. `npm run deploy`
6. If you change the deployed Worker in future, update the default feedback endpoint in the panel source.
   - Current deployed Worker: `https://bible-song-pro-feedback.johnbatey-bsp.workers.dev/api/github-feedback`

The Worker setup is documented in [feedback-worker/README.md](feedback-worker/README.md).
